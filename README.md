# Overview

On top of that, I want to introduce you to the topic of Natural Language Processing.Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence
concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

## Instructions

`cd` into your new folder and run:

- `npm install`

## Setting up the API

### Step 1: Signup for an API key

First, you will need to go [here](https://developer.aylien.com/signup). Signing up will get you an API key. Don't worry, at the time of this course, the API is free to use up to 1000 requests per day or 333 intensive requests. It is free to check how many requests you have remaining for the day.

- [ ] Create a new `.env` file in the root of your project
- [ ] Fill the .env file with your API keys like this:

```
API_ID=**************************
API_KEY=**************************
```

- [ ] Add this code to the very top of your server/index.js file:

## Run the project

### DEV mode

```
npm run build-dev
```

and in other terminal

```
npm start
```

### PROD mode

```
npm run build-prod
```

it will generate a dist folder with the static files
